# Changelog

All notable changes to packetsonde. Format roughly follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added — TLS fingerprints
- **JA4 (client) + JA4S (server)** (FoxIO 2023) emitted alongside the existing JA3 / JA3S / JA4X in `tls.metadata` evidence. JA4 surfaces real TLS version via `supported_versions`, drops GREASE, sorts ciphers and extensions for stability under Chrome-style extension shuffling, and includes signature_algorithms in original order. Pure parser on the already-captured `client_hello` / `server_hello` — no new deps, no probe behavior changes.

### Added — process-level detection track (Linux)
Layered, post-exploitation behavioral sensor for the agent's host. Off by default (`[detect]`).
- **Collection primitives** — `fanotify` in the privilege-separated worker captures process/file/socket activity, enriched from `/proc` with an ancestry walk to the owning service/session, fanned out over a multi-consumer activity ring. New `packetsonde watch [--follow]` tails the JSONL records.
- **Declared-policy overwatch** — brain-side module compares observed activity to each unit's own `systemd` sandbox directives and flags violations; `learn` mode accumulates per-unit envelopes and `packetsonde sandbox-suggest <unit>` synthesizes a tightened sandbox stanza.
- **Learned per-exe baseline** — hybrid learn/enforce allowlist keyed by executable across three signals: file paths, network destinations, and spawn parents. Novel → candidate → operator `approve`/`deny` via the new `baseline` verb (denied → anomaly).

### Added — fleet + central integration
- **Agent registration/enrollment** — Ed25519 keystore identity, `[central]` config, `packetsonde register` (lands a `pending` agent for operator validation).
- **Observation reporting** — agent ships queued passive findings to central in bounded batches.
- **Relay forwarding** — deep-segment agents reach central through an edge hop (signed, chain-verified ingest).
- **Collector / return-routing** — `packetsonde collect` receives + presents signed findings central-free.
- **Interface monitor + dynamic capture interface** — live capture-interface state and selection.

### Added — recipe framework
- Signed declarative audit recipes that live client-side and are pushed JIT to a remote agent over the `--via` channel; the agent stays a primitive-runner with no offensive content at rest.

### Added — audit kinds
- `haproxy`, `proxmox`, `nginx`, `opnsense` — `audit` now covers 26 services.

### Build
- Single-source build version (`PS_VERSION_STR` in the root CMake drives CLI + agent + priv worker); dev-push policy bumps the patch value per fleet build so a binary swap is verifiable. See `docs/build.md`.

## [v1.6] — 2026-05-20

### Added — agent network protocol
Closes the `--via <agent>` follow-on. End-to-end mTLS channel for remote-segment audits; reuses the Ed25519 keystore from v1.5 discovery so identity and trust model are unified across the project.

- **`src/lib/agent_proto.{h,c}`** — transport-independent wire framing. `uint32_t length || JSON{...}` per frame, 1 MiB ceiling, canonical message types: `hello`, `audit`, `finding`, `log`, `error`, `bye`. Conservative top-level `type` scanner so the dispatch path doesn't pay for a full JSON parse on every frame.
- **`src/lib/agent_transport.{h,c}`** — TLS 1.3 mTLS with Ed25519 self-signed certs. Identity == pubkey, no PKI, no CA, no chain validation. Built-in verify callback accepts the chain unconditionally; the real check is a post-handshake SHA-256 of the peer's `SubjectPublicKeyInfo` compared to a pinned fingerprint. `SSL` wrapped in the `ps_ap_io` abstraction so framing code works over both plain fds (tests) and TLS sessions.
- **CLI `--via <agent>`** — when set, `packetsonde audit ...` dispatches to a remote agent instead of the local audit modules. Resolves the agent from `agents.toml` (`key_fingerprint` pin required), opens the mTLS channel, sends `hello` + `audit`, streams `finding` frames back with a `via_agent` field spliced in.
- **agent `network_listener` module** — operator opt-in (`PS_AGENT_LISTEN_MODE=persistent|knock|both`). Accept loop, pthread per session (capped via `PS_AGENT_MAX_CLIENTS`, default 64). On valid audit request, forks `packetsonde --jsonl audit ...` as a subprocess and pipes each JSONL line out as a `finding` frame. Audit-side crashes can't take down the agent.
- **Knock-then-listen stealth mode** — bit 0 of the existing discovery probe flags = `PS_DISCOVERY_FLAG_REQUEST_SESSION`. The discovery_listener calls a cross-module hook into network_listener to bind a fresh ephemeral TCP socket for one accept; the discovery reply advertises that port. Between knocks the agent has no listening socket at all — port scans return nothing distinguishable from a quiet host. CLI side: `knock = "true"` + optional `broadcast = "..."` in `agents.toml`.
- **End-to-end test (`test_via_e2e`)** — drives a real `packetsonde --via testagent audit ssh` against a `test_network_listener_driver` that hosts the agent module, with a Python mock SSH server as the audit target. Asserts `ssh.metadata`, `ssh.old_version`, and `via_agent` all appear in the finding stream.

- `v1.6`

## [v1.5] — 2026-05-20

### Added — audit kinds
Three new audit kinds; `audit` verb now covers 21 services.

- **`audit rdp`** — RDP exposure + NLA detection on TCP/3389. Speaks the X.224 / TPKT handshake, sends an `RDP_NEG_REQ` advertising RDP / TLS / HYBRID / HYBRID_EX, parses the `RDP_NEG_RSP`. Emits `rdp.metadata` (info), `rdp.exposed` (medium), and `rdp.no_nla` (high) when the server selects plain RDP or TLS-only — the BlueKeep-class exposure where pre-auth code lives on the listener.
- **`audit mssql`** — Microsoft SQL Server pre-login probe on TCP/1433. TDS Pre-Login packet, parses version + encryption posture. Emits `mssql.metadata` (info), `mssql.no_encryption` (high, encryption=OFF/NOT_SUPPORTED), `mssql.old_version` (medium, major < 13 / pre-SQL Server 2016).
- **`audit kafka`** — Kafka broker reachability + unauthenticated cluster-metadata disclosure on TCP/9092. ApiVersions v0 + Metadata v1; if the broker returns cluster metadata without SASL/ACL gating, that's the common "open kafka" exposure. Emits `kafka.metadata` (info) and `kafka.unauthenticated` (high).

All three include integration tests with mock servers.

### Added — `audit tls` enrichments
- **JA3 + JA3S fingerprints** in `tls.metadata`. Captures the raw `ClientHello` and `ServerHello` via `SSL_CTX_set_msg_callback`, computes canonical fingerprint strings + MD5s, drops them into the evidence as `ja3` / `ja3_str` / `ja3s` / `ja3s_str`. GREASE values (RFC 8701) stripped so fingerprints are stable across probes. JA3 lets defenders recognise packetsonde traffic; JA3S groups hosts by TLS-stack fingerprint behind LBs / WAFs / CDNs.

### Added — agent discovery
End-to-end zero-listener discovery for `packetsonded` instances on remote subnets. Companion brainstorm at `docs/specs/agent-discovery-brainstorm.md`.

- **`src/lib/discovery.{h,c}`** — 144-byte signed probe / 136-byte signed reply wire format (reply strictly < probe = no amplification). Ed25519 sign/verify via OpenSSL, bounded replay LRU (4096 entries, `(pubkey,nonce)` keyed).
- **`src/lib/keystore.{h,c}`** — Ed25519 keypair generate/save/load, SHA-256 fingerprint helper. Raw 32-byte pub + 32-byte seed on disk (seed mode 0600).
- **`packetsonde key {generate,list,fingerprint,revoke}`** — CLI key management. Keys live under `$PS_KEY_DIR` (defaults to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/packetsonde/keys`). Revocation prints the line the operator pastes into agents.
- **`packetsonde discover agents <cidr|broadcast>`** — signed broadcast probe + listen window; emits `discovery.agent` (info) per validated reply with `agent_pub_fingerprint`, `listen_ip`, `listen_port` in evidence. CLI flags: `--wait`, `--key`, `--max-skew`, `--cover-port`. Bad signatures, expired timestamps, replays, and unauthorized pubkeys are silent drops.
- **`packetsonded` discovery_listener module** — pcap consumer inspects every captured broadcast packet for the PSDP magic, validates probe, replies via plain DGRAM unicast back to the probe's source IP:port. No listening socket is ever bound — the agent is invisible to port scans. Env config: `PS_DISCOVERY_ENABLED`, `PS_KEY_DIR`, `PS_DISCOVERY_AGENT_KEY`, `PS_DISCOVERY_AUTHORIZED_DIR`, `PS_DISCOVERY_LISTEN_IP`, `PS_DISCOVERY_LISTEN_PORT`, `PS_DISCOVERY_MAX_SKEW_MS_CAP`. Default off; operator opts in.

### Added — flow export compatibility
NetFlow exporter brought up to maximum-compatibility for off-the-shelf collectors (Kentik, nfdump/nfcapd, ntopng, Logstash, Elastic, Splunk Stream, Wireshark).

- **NetFlow v9 templates** now include `FIRST_SWITCHED(22)` + `LAST_SWITCHED(21)` — collectors get true flow start/end times instead of falling back to packet arrival time.
- **IPFIX (RFC 7011) export** added as a third supported version (`version = 10`). 16-byte header with absolute `exportTime`, Template Set ID 2, 64-bit `octetTotalCount`(85) / `packetTotalCount`(86) (no 32-bit wrap at high rates), `flowStartMilliseconds`(152) / `flowEndMilliseconds`(153) as absolute uint64 ms since epoch. Field IDs 1-31 share IANA numbers with NetFlow v9 so dual-protocol collectors see consistent semantics.
- **Operator-configurable export target** via env: `PS_NETFLOW_COLLECTOR` (`host[:port]`, default `127.0.0.1:2055`), `PS_NETFLOW_VERSION` (`5|9|10`, default 9), `PS_NETFLOW_SOURCE_ID`.

sFlow is intentionally not implemented — sample-based protocol mismatches our aggregate-flow data model.

- `v1.5`

## [v1.4] — 2026-05-20

### Added
- **`probe traceroute --proto tcp`** — TCP-connect traceroute. Non-blocking `connect()` per TTL, `select()` over both the TCP fd and the ICMP listener — whichever fires first decides the hop. Intermediate routers appear via ICMP TTL exceeded; destination is reached when SO_ERROR comes back as 0 (open) or ECONNREFUSED (closed). Default target port 80 (override with `--port`). All three modes wired up (classic / paris / dublin); Paris binds src_port for a stable ECMP tuple, Dublin walks N flows with different src_ports. Cuts through stateful firewalls that drop UDP-traceroute payloads.
- **`probe traceroute --proto icmp`** — ICMP-echo traceroute. SOCK_DGRAM/IPPROTO_ICMP (unprivileged on macOS and on Linux when `ping_group_range` admits the user). Hand-built ICMP echo request, walks TTLs, reads TTL-exceeded (type 11) and echo-reply (type 0) responses on the same socket. The `--mode` flag is accepted for grammar parity but ICMP has only one flow tuple in practice.
- **`audit snmp`** — SNMP v1/v2c default-community detection on UDP/161. Hand-built BER GetRequest for sysDescr.0 with candidate communities `public` then `private`, v2c then v1. A valid GetResponse with matching request-id means the community is accepted. Emits `snmp.metadata` (info, with version + sysDescr) and `snmp.default_community` (high). Integration test included (mock SNMP responder).
- **`audit ldap`** — anonymous-bind detection. Sends a v3 LDAP BindRequest with empty credentials, parses the BindResponse resultCode. Emits `ldap.metadata` (info), `ldap.anonymous_bind` (medium, server accepts anon bind), `ldap.plaintext` (low, port 389 not 636/LDAPS).
- **`audit imap`** — IMAP banner + CAPABILITY parse. Emits `imap.metadata` (info, with `starttls` and `logindisabled` flags), `imap.no_starttls` (medium, port 143 without STARTTLS), `imap.plaintext_login` (high, port 143 allows LOGIN without STARTTLS + no LOGINDISABLED).
- **`audit pop3`** — POP3 banner + CAPA parse. Emits `pop3.metadata` (info), `pop3.no_stls` (medium, port 110 without STLS).
- **`scan udp <target|cidr> [-p PORTS]`** — UDP scanner. Uses connected-UDP sockets so closed ports surface as `ECONNREFUSED` via kernel-handled ICMP port-unreachable (no raw socket required). Per-port protocol-aware probes elicit responses from common UDP services: DNS (port 53, mDNS 5353), NTP (123), SNMP (161, community "public"), SSDP (1900), NetBIOS Name Service (137). Unknown ports get a single null byte. Default port list covers 53/67/69/123/137/161/500/514/1900/5353/11211. Emits `scan.udp.open` (info, with `response_bytes` and `preview_hex` in evidence) for ports that respond with payload. Silent ports (open|filtered) and closed ports do not emit — keeps the JSONL stream signal-dense.

Read the local-vs-remote behavior carefully: a kernel that doesn't return ICMP unreachable to the scanner (most cloud/firewalled setups) makes closed and silent indistinguishable, which is inherent to unprivileged UDP scanning. Raw-socket UDP scanning (Paris-style with manual ICMP receive) is a follow-on.

### Integration test coverage
Mock servers via Python + FIFO readiness sync are now the template for audit integration tests. New: `test_audit_ssh`, `test_audit_imap`, `test_audit_pop3`, `test_audit_snmp`. 29/29 tests pass.

### License
PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 is now modified to exclude government use. Government / state-affiliated use is treated as commercial use; charitable, educational, research, and personal use remain permitted.

## [v1.3] — 2026-05-20

### Added — pluggable audit ABI
The `audit` verb is now extensible without recompiling the CLI. Each audit kind is a single C file that exports `struct ps_audit_module` and compiles to a `.so` / `.dylib`. A loader scans `$PS_AUDITS_DIR` / `~/.config/packetsonde/audits/` / system paths at first call, dedupes by name, and lets user plugins shadow built-ins. All 14 existing audit kinds were converted to this ABI; each is statically linked into the binary AND built as a loadable plugin under `build/src/cli/audit/`.

- `src/lib/audit_module.h` — stable ABI (struct ps_audit_module, struct ps_audit_api, PS_AUDIT_ABI_VERSION).
- `src/cli/audit_loader.{h,c}` — dlopen + directory scan.
- Dispatcher (`src/cli/verbs/audit.c`) now owns output-emitter setup, format selection, snapshot, and close — was ~25 lines of boilerplate duplicated across every audit module.
- `docs/guides/writing-audit-plugins.md` — operator guide for shipping custom audits.
- `examples/audit-plugin/audit-vnc.c` — working ~100-line external plugin example with macOS/Linux build script.

### Added — new verb
- **`packetsonde report [path]`** — reads JSONL findings from a file or stdin, sorts by (severity descending, host, kind), and writes a Markdown deliverable grouped under severity headings with per-host subsections. Each finding renders with target, source, timestamp, and evidence. Closes the "compliance reports" follow-on from the v1 spec.

### Added — audit kinds
Three more audit kinds; `audit` verb now covers 14 services total.

- **`audit smtp`** — reads banner, sends EHLO, parses capability advertisement. Emits `smtp.metadata` (info) and `smtp.no_starttls` (medium, when STARTTLS is missing on port 25 or 587). Open-relay test deferred behind a future opt-in flag.
- **`audit mysql`** — reads MySQL/MariaDB initial handshake (sent on connect). Emits `mysql.metadata`, `mysql.old_version` (medium, < 8.0 — 5.x is EOL), `mysql.reachable` (low, posture marker).
- **`audit postgresql`** — sends SSLRequest, reads the single-byte response. Emits `postgresql.metadata`, `postgresql.no_ssl` (high, server refuses SSL), `postgresql.reachable` (low).

### Tags
- `v1.3`

## [v1.2] — 2026-05-20

### Added — traceroute modes
- **`probe traceroute --mode paris`** — holds the UDP flow tuple constant across every TTL probe so every hop traverses the same ECMP-balanced path.
- **`probe traceroute --mode dublin`** — enumerates ECMP alternative paths by walking multiple Paris-style flows with different source ports (`--flow-count N`, default 8). Deduplicates hops by (ttl, addr).

### Added — audit kinds
Seven new audit kinds; `audit` verb now covers 11 services total.

- **`audit smb`** — SMB1 detection via a minimal NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL request offering only the NT LM 0.12 dialect. Emits `smb.metadata` (info) and `smb.smb1_enabled` (high — EternalBlue / WannaCry surface).
- **`audit telnet`** — Telnet exposure detection. Plaintext + deprecated; reaching the port is itself the finding. Emits `telnet.exposed` (high) with the captured banner.
- **`audit ftp`** — FTP banner + anonymous-login probe. Emits `ftp.metadata` (info), `ftp.plaintext_exposed` (medium), and `ftp.anonymous_allowed` (high) when `USER anonymous` succeeds.
- **`audit redis`** — Redis NOAUTH detection. Sends `INFO`; if the server replies with data (instead of `-NOAUTH`), emits `redis.noauth` (critical) and `redis.metadata` (info) with version, mode, OS extracted from the INFO payload.
- **`audit ntp`** — NTP service reachability (mode-3) + monlist amplification probe (mode-7 REQ_MON_GETLIST_1, CVE-2013-5211). Emits `ntp.metadata`, `ntp.monlist_amplification` (critical, with computed amplification factor), `ntp.mode7_enabled` (low) when mode-7 is present but the specific request is rejected.
- **`audit memcached`** — sends `version\r\n` on TCP/11211. Emits `memcached.metadata` and `memcached.noauth_exposed` (critical) — memcached's text protocol has no authentication.
- **`audit elasticsearch`** — HTTP GET `/` on port 9200, parses cluster_name + version. Emits `elasticsearch.metadata` and `elasticsearch.unauthenticated` (critical) when the cluster API is reachable without auth.

### Added — findings tooling
- **`findings stats [path]`** — reads JSONL findings from a file or stdin and prints aggregate counts by severity, kind, source, and host. Sorted descending. Useful for "what does today look like" review of an `--auto-append` file.

### Tags
- `v1.2`

## [v1.1] — 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- `audit tls` now reliably detects TLS 1.0/1.1 servers and weak ciphers on hosts where the system OpenSSL policy would otherwise prevent the probe handshakes (`OPENSSL_INIT_NO_LOAD_CONFIG` + `SECLEVEL=0` + permissive cipher list on probe contexts). Integration test re-enabled assertions for `tls.weak_protocol` and `tls.weak_cipher` (now 7 kinds asserted, was 5).

### Added
- **`audit http`** — security-header hygiene against HTTP/HTTPS targets. Emits: `http.metadata`, `http.missing_hsts` / `http.weak_hsts` (HTTPS), `http.missing_xcto`, `http.missing_frame_protection`, `http.missing_csp`, `http.missing_referrer_policy`, `http.server_version_leak`.
- **`audit ssh`** — SSH server banner audit. Emits: `ssh.metadata`, `ssh.old_version` (OpenSSH < 7.4).
- **`tls.metadata`** info finding emitted by `audit tls`. Captures full TLS posture as evidence: protocol, cipher, subject CN, issuer CN, notBefore, notAfter, cert SHA-256, SANs (DNS + IP). Gives auditors "what does this server look like" alongside "what's wrong."
- `docs/specs/agent-network-protocol-brainstorm.md` — pre-brainstorm design questions for follow-on #1 (10 questions across transport, identity, wire format, session model, with leans and tradeoffs).
- `README.md`, `docs/specs/viz-notes.md`, this changelog.

### Notes
- Audit verb now covers 4 kinds: `tls`, `dns`, `http`, `ssh`.
- 25/25 tests pass.

## [v1.0] — 2026-05-20

Initial release of the CLI toolkit. Three phased plans landed:

### Plan 1 — CLI foundation
- Repo restructure: `agent/` → `src/agent/`, sibling `src/lib/` and `src/cli/`.
- `libpacketsonde` (`json`, `log`, `ipc`, `ulid`) shared between agent and CLI.
- `packetsonde` skeleton: arg parser, verb dispatch table, `version` verb.
- `packetsonde agent <subcmd>` folds in the former `psctl` handlers; `psctl` binary retired.
- PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 license.

### Plan 2 — Findings & first audit
- Finding record + JSON/text serializers (`v: 1` stable wire format).
- Thread-safe output emitter (text / JSON / JSONL / quiet, TTY auto-detection, `--auto-append`).
- Token-bucket rate limiter + pthread worker pool + bounded MPSC queue.
- SIGINT/SIGTERM cancel handler.
- `audit tls` via OpenSSL — 8 finding kinds across protocol, cipher, and certificate hygiene.
- Integration test against `openssl s_server`.
- Per-run summary on stderr (severity histogram + duration).

### Plan 3 — Verb breadth
- `util/targets` — CIDR + port-list parsers.
- `findings tail` / `findings filter` (JSONL stream processing with filter expressions).
- `config show` / `config path` + `agents.toml` registry parser.
- `--fail-on severity>=LEVEL` gates exit code (3 = matching findings present).
- `probe tcp` — single TCP probe with RTT + banner.
- `lib/traceroute` core (UDP classic).
- `probe traceroute --proto udp --mode classic`.
- `audit dns` — version.bind leak + open-recursion detection.
- `discover neighbors` — local ARP/NDP table.
- `scan ports` — connect-scan with CIDR + port-list.
- `discover hosts` — port-set host sweep.
